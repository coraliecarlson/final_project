    explain: "Under the Lacey Act, if an animal is illegal to kill in the country where it was harvested, then it's also illegal to sell in the U.S. Because Indonesia bans the killing of kerivoula picta, the sale of this taxidermy bat in the U.S. is illegal. ",

    explain: "U.S. law generally prohibits selling or buying cat or dog fur, and since a taxidermy cat includes the fur, this one is banned. Plus the Tariff Act of 1930 prevents the importing or exporting of cat or dog fur. This one is for sale in Britian, so there's no way to get it home legally. Note: Taxiderming your own cat or dog is just fine, as long as you don't sell it. ",

    explain: "Now you know how a patchwork of laws aim to protect animals â€“ and how banned animal-made products frequently end up online anyway.
